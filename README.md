# Web-App Development - 2023

## Project 1 - Book Store Collection

As part of Web-Application Development we were tasksed with creating an app that has CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
I chose doing a book collection for storing books of different categories & genres.

The main home page contains a grid of cards that display the book cover image and the book title.
The book cover image is got using the node-isbn library.


## Getting Started
